# Loop Journal

Append-only narrative of every autonomous beat. **Never deleted** — this file and
`BLOCKED.md` are the record of what an unattended run actually did.

One block per step. Opening block written *before* work starts, closing block
after. A step with an opening block and no closing block means a beat died
mid-work; the next beat recovers from its checkpoint.

Format:

```
### <step> — <title>  ·  beat N  ·  <ISO timestamp>
**Class:** logic | ui | native
**Plan:** <files to create / modify>
**Tests:** <test file> — <N> cases, confirmed failing before implementation

**Gate:** tsc ✅ jest ✅ eslint ✅
**Review:** pass ✅ / fail ❌ — <findings, if any>
**Checkpoint:** <sha>
**Result:** done ✅ / quarantined ⛔ / blocked 🚧
**Notes:** <what a human would want to know>

### BOOTSTRAP · beat 0 · 2026-08-12T21:47:20Z

**Baseline gate:** tsc ✅ · jest ✅ (16 suites, 195 tests) · eslint ✅
**HEAD:** `e0020342` — "feat: Phase 1 is finished"

Spine created. Steps classified in `state.json`: Phase 9 and 1.6.1 deferred,
Phase 3 / 4.1 / 4.2 / 7.1 / 1.2 marked `native` (implement + queue, never tick).

Working tree carries a large uncommitted staged change from prior sessions
(capsule/type/persona routes, settings screens, several new slices). The first
working beat must resolve this before starting a step — a checkpoint commit is
meaningless on top of unreviewed staged work.

Reconciliation note for beat 1: `entities/capsule`, `capsule-type`, `field`,
`audit`, `link`, `tag`, `attachment` contain **only** a bare `index.ts`, and the
capsules/types routes are placeholder screens. These are scaffolding, not
implementations — Phase 6's unchecked boxes are correct. Do not mistake file
existence for done-ness.
